    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In the 111-lab, the experiment does not end when you have finished collecting your data. In many labs, you will be required to perform a detailed analysis of the data you have acquired. The point of any scientific experiment is to make quantitative statements about the properties of the physical world. A common question is, are your measurements consistent with a particular theory or not? This question can only be answered by careful analysis, including both systematic uncertainties and statistical error.</p>\n",
    "<p>The goals of this exercise are twofold. One is to familiarize students with the basics of error analysis. Ideally, this will serve as a guide during the acquisition and analysis of data throughout the advanced lab. The second goal is to introduce students to the Python computing environment, which you will be using throughout the semester.</p>\n",
    "<p>Before starting on EAX, please look over either the Python Tutorials <a href=\"https://github.com/avirukt/intro_python\">https://github.com/avirukt/intro_python</a> or the<a href=\"/matlabintro\"> </a><a href=\"/matlabintro\" title=\"Intro to Matlab\">Intro to </a><a href=\"/matlabintro\">Matlab</a> section.

    "#### Problem 1: Poisson statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to measure the activity (number of decays per second, a unit known as Becquerel) of a radioactive source so that we can use it to calibrate the equipment of the gamma-ray experiment. We use an electronic counter and a timer to measure the number of decays in a given time interval. In round numbers we obtain 1000 decays in 10 minutes. How long does it take (in seconds) in order to determine the activity with a statistical uncertainty of 2%? Explain.\n",

    "b) In the muon lifetime experiment we obtain a histogram for the decay rate as a function of the time after the muon enters the detector and announces its presence. We expect the distribution (the histogram) to be described by an exponential function. Rather than fitting with an exponential function, it is more convenient to plot the logarithm of the decay rate as a function of time and then fit a straight line to it. Since each data point ($x_i,y_i$) has a statistical error, $\\sigma_i$, associated with it, qualitatively, what happens to these errors when the semi-log histogram $(x_i,\\log{y_i})$ is plotted? Explain and illustrate. what happens, quantitatively? Assume $y_i$ is reasonably large.\n",

    "b) From what s/he knows about the equipment used to measure the resonant frequency, your lab partner hastily estimates the uncertainty in the measurement of $f$ to be $\\sigma(f) = 0.07$ MHz. Estimate the probability that the straight line you found is an adequate description of the observed data if it is distributed with the uncertainty guessed by your lab partner. (Hint: use scipy.stats.chi2 class to compute the quantile of the chi2 distribution).  What can you conclude from these results? \n",

    "c) Assume that the best-fit line found in Part 1 is a good fit to the data. Estimate the uncertainty in measurement of $y$ from the scatter of the observed data about this line. Again, assume that all the data points have equal weight. Use this to estimate the uncertainty in both the slope and the intercept of the best-fit line. This is the technique you will use in the Optical Pumping lab to determine the uncertainties in the fit parameters.\n",
